proposed workflow:
Update the version number in package.json,  using npm version (minor, major, etc)
this will create a commit and also a tag
Push that commit, use git push --tags


On the Jenkins side - for publishing
Jenkins clones the repo
Jenkins runs npm publish --from-git
Package is published !!
